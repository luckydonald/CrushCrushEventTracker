❯ The problem with the failed commit (which is not relevant) is `Co-Authored-By`. There should be a git commit hook - which would prevent this - and should be made sure to work by claude's init script - but never triggers?
Ah, I figured that the "deny" in the claude settings is executed first.
Is there a "on-deny" hook or similar we can hook into, to enhance it with that information that the `Co-Authored-By' and git actions which blindly add all files (`git add . …`, `git add -A …` etc.) are not allowed, instead of just the `Error: Permission to use Bash with command … has been denied.`.
So like our git hook would, if it were to run first/regardless (but it clearly shouldn't. Again, enrich the deny output)

❯ Yes, support both `git commit -m "*Co-Authored-By*"` and `git commit -F` where the file with the commit message is given, which we can then look into as well, to make sure. Support multiple variants of those flags, combined, too. If everything else fails, we still got the commit hook after all.

❯ _The only way to get rich messages is to remove the deny entries and let the `PermissionRequest` hook own the decision. The hook still denies — it just does so with explanation_ so the `PermissionRequest` hook only runs after the `deny` list?

❯ _PermissionRequest hook is effectively "runs before the *interactive* permission prompt, but after the *automatic* deny check."_ This is speculative, right? Can we check that in docs or somewhere?

❯ Create a hook for logging the plan mode decisions. Similar as we hook into `UserPromptSubmit`, I want to document the decisions taken when those multiple choice questions are asked - if possible with the full options to choose from - so it's clear later what the reasoning looked like.

❯ Commit, with prefix `[base] ai: Run: …`.

❯ wait, this commit contained `Co-Authored-By`. Why could we commit?

❯ Create proper test for it in the ai/tests folder.

❯ Also I've attempted your example from earlier, but parsing worked fine-ish, shlex did not error:
```py
>>> import shlex
>>> shlex.split("git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\nfoo\nEOF\n)\"")
['git', 'commit', '-m', "$(cat <<'EOF'\nfoo\nEOF\n)"]
```

❯ Test for
```shell
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
      [base] ai: Run: add PermissionRequest hooks for git add and Co-Authored-By policy

      Replace generic deny-list entries for `git add .` / `git add -A` with a
      `PermissionRequest` hooks that returns rich denial reasons. Also adds
      Co-Authored-By detection for `git commit` messages (via -m, --message=,
      or -F file). The commit-msg hooks remains as final fallback.
      EOF
      )"
```
as well.

❯ Now duplicate that test case with a proper co-Authored, and assert it fails because of shlex detecting it, not shlex erroring/the raw `x in y` workaround from earlier.

❯ commit this change

❯ Check d16d0a4f685c2871cda1b09a4ea56445d23f2d64, it could slip through.

⏺ Committed as d16d0a4. Note that .claude/settings.json wasn't picked up by git (likely gitignored), so only hook.sh was included in the commit — the settings change is still live
   on disk and active.

❯ Alright, commit that fix

❯ What does `Attribution is controlled via the settings.json` in the error message? I think that must be removed.

❯ Commit.

❯ /btw, is there a character suited for folder/file prefixes to imply "this is not very useful folder, don't look inside" like the dot would - and not taking up much space (dot is just a small symbol at the bottom of the "character field"), but which will in a typical folder/file sort appear _after_ all others - i.e. after `Z`?
❯ I've used `ai/°base` now, as that one is still easy enough to type on pretty much every system.

❯ Anyway, back to the `base` repo:
The @scripts/°base/ai/hooks/save-prompt/hook.sh (and @scripts/°base/ai/hooks/save-decision/hook.sh analogous) shall check if the current repo is `base` repo (this current singular prompt execution is) based on folder name and the fact that the remotes are `origin https://luckydonald@github.com/luckydonald/base.git` and `empty   https://luckydonald@github.com/EmptyAAS/empty.git`.
It shall not be a guard, but instead of writing to `ai/query.md` it shall write to `ai/°base/query.md`.
So check that:
1. the folder name is `base`
2. it has only `origin` and `empty` set as remotes
3. the url of origin is luckydonald/base (`.git`, `luckydonald@` optional)

❯ Set up the Git LFS to support `.png` and `.jp(e)g`. Make sure the `README.md` contains the necessary commands for setup.
❯ That readme change for git lfs install is not very thorough. It shall be part of the installation section properly, and definitly also in the quick copy-past command block.
❯ Also add the command for pre-commit, too.

❯ Edit @scripts/°base/ai/hooks/save-prompt/hook.sh to ignore if the message is just a single command of the following list: `/commit-with-lplp-style`.

❯ Earlier you managed to commit with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic>` again. Analyze why this managed to get past the `PermissionRequest` check.
The commit which I since rebased and fixed was `base 5338ebc` with the title `ai: skip logging for internal tooling prompt command`, so you can match it in the earlier log.
In any way, also add `<noreply@anthropic>` to the "forbidden" strings, like `Co-Authored-By`.
❯ For those kind of exceptions in there, make sure to raise those errors. Like instead, return a "deny" with the following deny text:
> COMMAND AUDIT ERROR: While trying to calculate if this command is allowed to execute, the script encountered an error. STOP EXECUTION NOW, and show the error to the user, so they can ask for that script to be fixed. Do not attempt to work around it unless specifically asked to by the user. Error message: ...
❯ As it's duplicated, have a func for that. Also, the stacktrace should be shown.

❯ Fix @.claude/hooks/permission-check.py - it allowed the last commit, clearly with `Co-Authored-By`.
Also figure out why the pre-commit hook (@ai/scripts/git/hook/commit/reject_co_authored_by.py) did not trigger or did not prevent it either (`git lfs` interfering?)
❯ First commit via commit style - the previous fixes you already did.

❯ If there is husky, make sure it plays nicely with the rest, and the result is what we want.
Is that yorkie still needed/installed? Should we uninstall it then?
Yeah, in the end I'd want `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`, that makes sense.
In fact there's also the push one, check out the claude `SessionStart` hook which tries to set it as there's no proper husky-like thingo available otherwise.
Ah, maybe we can merge those as `ai/scripts/init/checkout.sh`?
❯ yes, continue with the checkout.sh consolidation
❯ `ai: recorded decision` should be squashed/amended the same way `ai: updated prompt` does

❯ Write me a hook where changing/creating a plan copies it to ài/plans/*.md` and commits it via claude hook py script

Enable it with `--enable hooks` or `[features].hooks` in config.toml. See https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic#feature-flags for details.
› Instead, have a python part in the sync script check for that - and fix it after a y/n/exit. Exit shows the path exactly for convenience.

› Fix the `°base` folder selection for automatic `ai: updated prompt` commits broken with either b142385153f6b44d208532036b95a1cb4dd9c9b2 - or they were never working for `codex` before (only `claude`). While at it, make sure those automated commits - including plans and such will prefix commit with `[base] ` like usual for this repository.

See commit dbe390bf1766c8227fc3d9c37315a00e7629d8a9 first writing the plan to the query file,
and then immediatly after writing garbage (stdout apparently) to a new plan file in 8f9f93cf2fa3eec36bc3cc69c5f16faac49e584c.
Instead it should write what was in the query file to the plan file.
Make sure to not corrupt the code for claude, the fix only applies to codex.
Also check if this message starting of the plan gets autocommited at least.

› Note that the files mentioned in the commits where fixed manually later by me.

› Migrate claude hook setup to also have a claude param to the script - the commit one already does it like that.

› The $commit-with-lplp-style skill is not good in selecting the word after the `[where]`. Currently it often writes stuff like `[fronend] fix: ai: Run: …`, but it shouldn't be this feat/fix/… commit style (forgot the name), but the component or topic of the change. I.e. `[frontend] admin: Implemented user deletion UI.` or `[backend] models: Added models for cool feature.`. If we're rather on a feature branch or doing a lot of work on the same feature `[backend] cool feature: Added the models.` or similar is possible too. Also notice that every commit shall be ended with a sentence separator, e.g. `.:,!?`. It doesn't need to be a full sentence for that, and the choice is rather based on the rest of the message; Like if you need the information in the detailed rest of the commit message, then it would indicate that with an `:`, otherwise, if it can stand on it's own, and the body is only enhancing it, it would be `.` Usually `.` is the right choice.

Like it's fine to add code and plan, the issue is if the plan is overwritten by a later plan - i.e. loosing the history of plan changes.
Same goes with merging the prompt file commits etc. If it meaningfully changes the query - or is a totally separate topic altoghether, it should stay separate.

❯ Add the git username config to the README. In the copy block, add as last line that the name should be `Lucky Lucy` - the email can be different and does not need to be checked. Below add a second code block setting the git local vars for email + name, using this repo as values for now.

❯ No, in the first block don't SET it, ASSERT it, calling it out if wrong in red text

❯ I reverted that commit. I meant @scripts/°base/git/remote/fix_username.py

❯ It's a TUI app. Ask to fix it.

❯ Add a flag to yes them ahead of time. If they are correct it's a noop.

(blockquote me, not in prompt). Then it repeats the full file we just captured earlier with the `save plan …` commit. That shall be stripped.

❯ /init but write it at `ai/°base/AGENTS.md`, and in the root `CLAUDE.md` instruct the AI to only read that file if you are base repo (dir name, git origin, whatever is fastest for you to figure out - i.e. is based on already available metadata - i.e. the system prompt, etc.). Tell immediatly that other projects using this _base_ are expected to overwrite the root `CLAUDE.md`. But as it's an automatic prompt, it shall be lightwight!

❯ /plan the claude hooks for plan mode are no longer triggering commits & adding the files to the correct folder it seems.

❯ I am now telling you to change something in that plan. Doing so should result in two changes:
1. Immediatly this very prompt is added at the end of `ai/°base/query.md`, and
2. after you wrote the new plan, `ai/°base/plans/010_*.md` should be updated by the file access or some relevant hook.
You can inspect **1.** right away, so you can see if that already needs fixing.
For **2.** we will see that after you update the plan. You will ask me to start implementing, and I will have to reject again, so you are given a chance to inspect the result before going into actual implementation phase.

❯ Thanks. I got the following options to choose from, where I exited out with number **4**:
> Claude has written up a plan and is ready to execute. Would you like to proceed?
>
>   1. Yes, and use auto mode
>   2. Yes, manually approve edits
>   3. No, refine with plan on Claude Code on the web
> ❯ 4. Tell Claude what to change
>      shift+tab to approve with this feedback

You should now check that the updated plan has a commit as well.
Afterwards we need to check option **1**, that it commits to the query as well, something about starting the implementation, and once more linking the plan. Obviously that can't be done in planning mode.

❯ Exiting again to give you another check round. Also please activte the lplp-commit-style skill when implementing the fix.
❯ /plan test plan for what we just implemented. Please tell me how to best test.

❯ I feel like this should have been plan #11, as it's too different?

❯ Check if the following is correct: @ai/°base/errors/8.md
Note, it's from claude at `/Users/user/Documents/programming/Shell/archive_apps`.

❯ But query and answer shouldn't be `0 chars`?

❯ Again, don't attepmt to fix `archive_apps`, the fix will land there eventually. Fix it here.

❯ /plan Back to that other claude session at `/Users/user/Documents/programming/Shell/archive_apps/`, in commit `ff301248d9cc1dbebd8d4d0a09dbf90b7b20a991` we asked claude to `❯ document your learnings.`, and it did so.
I can see the following writes, but it never seem to have triggered commits mirroring those to the local git, as the hooks should. Please investigate. The commands it triggered:
- `Write(/Users/user/.claude/projects/-Users-user-Documents-programming-Shell-archive-apps/memory/feedback_testing_archive_apps.md)`
- `Write(/Users/user/.claude/projects/-Users-user-Documents-programming-Shell-archive-apps/memory/project_ditto_zip_cp437.md)`
- `Write(/Users/user/.claude/projects/-Users-user-Documents-programming-Shell-archive-apps/memory/project_checksums_locale_sort.md)`
- `Write(/Users/user/.claude/projects/-Users-user-Documents-programming-Shell-archive-apps/memory/MEMORY.md)`
You should fix the issue only in this base repo, the fixes will be merged there eventually.

❯ /plan I want to have explore commands written to the prompt log, similar to `Task Notification:`.
Claude CLI writes:
```log
Explore(Explore record-memory hook and commit logic)
  ⎿  Done (33 tool uses · 46.9k tokens · 1m 41s)
```
I think we could write it like this:

@ai/°base/errors/9.expected.md

Activate /commit-with-lplp-style when executing the plan.

❯ Change the output dir for agent stuff to `ai/output/agents/NNN.task-id/` (+`output`)

❯ do not squash for this single time, I'll do it myself.

❯ /plan If `ai/.debug` file exists, all AI hooks shall write their payload to `ai/output/debug/`. Adapt paths for `°base` as usual.

❯ Here's some more stuff to do, they should all be commited separately, following the lplp style skill.
1. `.debug` as above.
2. Record `/compact` results, too.
3. For the `Task Notification:` prompt update, from [5.expected.md](./errors/5.expected.md), the last line (tools, tokens, time) is missing. Implement it.
4. Fix prompts-while-running for claude being lost.
   E.g. in this repo/prompt (blockquote me):
   > Change the output dir for agent stuff to `ai/output/agents/NNN.task-id/` (+`output`)
