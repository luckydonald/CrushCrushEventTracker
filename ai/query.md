# AI query log file

#### General AI development guidelines:
- You may refer to `ai/refrences` for code examples of other plugins or extra documentation provided for this task.
- When writing code, follow these guidelines:
  - Always prefer the early-return pattern to reduce nesting of `if`s, etc.
  - Similarly, prefer `if …` -> `continue`/`return`/`break` early in loops over large nested blocks.
- Language/stack-specific style constraints (Vue/TS frontend, Python backend, …), including test-writing expectations, now live in the `code-style` skill under `ai/skills/code-style/references/` — apply those instead of repeating them here.
- Remember to update the `/CHANGELOG.md` and `/README.md` if existent (including other pre-existing documentation).
- If you want to write Markdown summaries of the task you just did (only if specifically asked for by the user!) write those to `ai/summaries/` folder, and never into the root folder.
  - However, usually you don't need to write Markdown summaries.
- Please prefer to use the read file tool over weird constructs with `cat` etc. Terminal should not be needed for searches most of the time, either.

#### Previous user prompts:

❯ No, the logic shall be:
1. if `empty/init`: rebase (move) mane to `base/base`,
2. (else -> not initial) if we (old version of) `base/base` + our commits: rebase mane ontop `base/base`.
3. (else) Technically this means this branch must previously have the `base/base` merged: merge again with `base/base` (+autoshelve)

I guess checking for merge commits is easier than the clean base, but possibly not the tip of it, but only like commits ontop (rebase onto), so maybe the if should be flipped.
