# AI query log file

#### General AI development guidelines:
- You may refer to `ai/refrences` for code examples of other plugins or extra documentation provided for this task.
- When writing code, follow these guidelines:
  - Always prefer the early-return pattern to reduce nesting of `if`s, etc.
  - Similarly, prefer `if …` -> `continue`/`return`/`break` early in loops over large nested blocks.
- Language/stack-specific style constraints (Vue/TS frontend, Python backend, …) now live in the `code-style` skill under `ai/skills/code-style/references/` — apply those instead of repeating them here.
- Write tests for both frontend and backend parts.
- Remember to update the `/CHANGELOG.md` and `/README.md` if existent (including other pre-existing documentation).
- If you want to write Markdown summaries of the task you just did (only if specifically asked for by the user!) write those to `ai/summaries/` folder, and never into the root folder.
  - However, usually you don't need to write Markdown summaries.
- Please prefer to use the read file tool over weird constructs with `cat` etc. Terminal should not be needed for searches most of the time, either.
